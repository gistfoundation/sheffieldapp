Sheffield App
--------------

We're building a mobile App for Sheffield to help people navigate the city and expose more if its loveliness.
Once we're done it should be easy to find great places, events and transport links across the city.

Please sign up to our mailing list to get involved in the discussion:

We're meeting up next on May 12th at the GistLab for a hackday. Bring your laptops!

Debugging the sheffield mobile project:

adb -d logcat


Notes for GIST Devs..
I found the tutorial at http://wiki.appcelerator.org/display/guides/Cross+Platform+Navigation+Controller quite useful in the first place.

Android devs

Some notes on using android devices for debugging

Having done this.. "Install to phone" option should appear in right click menu for project.
